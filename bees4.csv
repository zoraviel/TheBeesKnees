Cretan honey bee,"Apis mellifera adami (often misspelled ""adamii"") is a western honey bee subspecies from the Mediterranean area, endemic to Crete.","A subspecies of Apis mellifera (the western honey bee), is the Cretan bee as classified by Ruttner 1975 and named by him after Brother Adam. The population on Crete has a similar genotype to Grecian populations, but Cretan bees are a more mixed population due to breeding and beekeeping practices (no pure populations on the island) (Harizanis & Odos).",Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Hymenoptera,Apidae,Apis,A.¬†mellifera,A.¬†m. adami,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_mellifera_adami
Carniolan honey bee,"The Carniolan honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica, Pollmann) is a subspecies of the western honey bee. The Carniolan honey bee is native to Slovenia, southern Austria, and parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.","The Carniolan honey bee is the subspecies of the Western honey bee that has naturalised and adapted to the Koƒçevje (Gottschee) sub-region of Carniola (Slovenia), the southern part of the Austrian Alps, Dinarides region, southern Pannonian plain and the northern Balkans.

Apis mellifera cecropia,"Apis mellifera cecropia, the Greek bee, is the subspecies of honey bee that is native to southern Greece. It is very similar to Apis mellifera ligustica, the Italian bee. it is favored for its extreme gentleness and lack of tendency to swarm. The Greek bee originates in Greece where the climate is Mediterranean, and cannot survive in the north of Europe where the climate is cooler[citation needed], and because of that they are not spread around the world much by commercial beekeepers. They are mainly only kept in southern Greece.","Greek bees generally tend to build up very quickly in the spring, with the queens being very prolific, resulting in strong hives. They also tend to make quite a lot of honey, but only in Mediterranean climates.",Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Hymenoptera,Apidae,Apis,A.¬†mellifera,A.¬†m. cecropia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_mellifera_cecropia

Italian bee,Apis mellifera ligustica is the Italian bee which is a subspecies of the western honey bee (Apis mellifera).,"The Italian honey bee is thought to originate from the continental part of Italy, south of the Alps, and north of Sicily. The subspecies may have survived the last Ice Age in Italy. It is genetically a different subspecies than that from the Iberian peninsula and from Sicily. It is the most widely distributed of all honey bees, and has proven adaptable to most climates from subtropical to cool temperate, but it is less successful in humid tropical regions. Italian bees that originate from the Ligurian alps in northern Italy are often referred to as the Ligurian bee.",Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Hymenoptera,Apidae,Apis,A.¬†mellifera,A.¬†m. ligustica,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_bee
Macedonian bee,"The Macedonian bee (Apis mellifera macedonica) is a subspecies of the Western honey bee. It is found mainly in North Macedonia, Northern Greece and other places in the Balkans as well. Originally this subspecies was described based on morphological characteristics by Friedrich Ruttner, as were the adami, cecropia and cypria subspecies.","The bee populations of Thrace, Macedonia, Central Greece and the Peloponnese are completely distinguishable from those on the island of Crete. Studies of bee populations in 2005[citation needed] from various areas of Greece (Ikaria, Kasos, Kythira, Phthiotis, Macedonia) and Cyprus analyzing mitochondrial DNA segments and finding differences in enzymatic restrictions, resulting in Apis mellifera adamii, Apis mellifera cecropia and Apis Cypria mellifera have a haplotype which differs from the Macedonian Apis mellifera haplotype, this subspecies being the most distant of all.",Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Hymenoptera,Apidae,Apis,A.¬†mellifera,A.¬†m. macedonica,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_mellifera_macedonica
European dark bee,"The European dark bee (Apis mellifera mellifera) is a subspecies of the western honey bee, whose original range stretched from west-central Russia through Northern Europe and probably down to the Iberian Peninsula. They belong to the 'M'¬†lineage of Apis mellifera. They are large for honey bees though they have unusually short tongues (5.7-6.4¬†mm) and traditionally were called the German Dark Bee or the Black German Bee, names still used today even though they are now considered an Endangered Breed in Germany. Their common name is derived from their brown-black color, with only a few lighter yellow spots on the abdomen. However today they are more likely to be called after the geographic / political region in which they live such as the British Black Bee, the Native Irish Honey Bee, the Cornish Black Bee and the Nordic Brown Bee, even though they are all the same subspecies, with the word ‚Äúnative‚Äù often inserted by local beekeepers, even in places where the bee is an introduced foreign species. It was domesticated in Europe and hives were brought to North America in the colonial era in 1622 where they were referred to as the English Fly by the Native American Indians.","A.¬†m. mellifera can be broadly distinguished from other subspecies by their stocky body, abundant thoracal and sparse abdominal hair which is brown, and overall dark coloration. Overall, when viewed from a distance, they appear blackish, or in mellifera, rich dark brown.",Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Hymenoptera,Apidae,Apis,A. mellifera,A. m.mellifera,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dark_bee
Maltese honey bee,"The Maltese honey bee, Apis mellifera ruttneri, is a subspecies of the western honey bee. It originates from Malta, where it is native."," 'The bee is a subspecies of the western honey bee that has naturalized and adapted to the environment of the Maltese Islands. It evolved as a different subspecies when the Maltese islands were cut off from mainland Europe. The Maltese bee likely contributed to the islands name as the ancient Greeks called the island ŒúŒµŒªŒØœÑŒ∑ (Melitƒì) meaning ""honey-sweet""",Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Hymenoptera,Apidae,Apis,A. mellifera,A. m. ruttneri,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_honey_bee
Cape honey bee,The Cape honey bee or Cape bee (Apis mellifera capensis) is a southern South African subspecies of the western honey bee.  They play a major role in South African agriculture and the economy of the Western Cape by pollinating crops and producing honey in the Western Cape region of South Africa.,"The Cape honey bee is unique among honey bee subspecies because workers can lay diploid, female eggs, by means of thelytoky, while workers of other subspecies (and, in fact, unmated females of virtually all other eusocial insects) can only lay haploid, male eggs. Not all workers are capable of thelytoky ‚Äì only those expressing the thelytoky phenotype, which is controlled by a recessive allele at a single locus (workers must be homozygous at this locus to be able to reproduce by thelytoky).",Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Hymenoptera,Apidae,Apis,A. mellifera,A. c. capensis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_mellifera_capensis
Arabian honey bee,"The Arabian honey bee (Apis mellifera jemenitica) is a subspecies of the western honey bee. It is native to the southern Arabian Peninsula, south of the Sahara, Sudan and Somalia. Based on morphological studies by Fredrich Ruttner, it is classified as a tropical African bee group.","Apis mellifera jemenitica is quite small and stocky of shape. The color of the abdomen of the workers shows one to three yellow rings, the yellow coloration is alternately extended. From the morphological data it partly resembles the eastern honey bee (Apis cerana).

East African lowland honey bee,"The East African lowland honey bee (Apis mellifera scutellata) is a subspecies of the western honey bee. It is native to central, southern and eastern Africa, though at the southern extreme it is replaced by the Cape honey bee (Apis mellifera capensis). This subspecies has been determined to constitute one part of the ancestry of the Africanized bees (also known as ""killer bees"") spreading through America.","The introduction of the Cape honey bee into northern South Africa poses a threat to East  African lowland honey bees. If a female worker from a Cape honey bee colony enters an East African lowland honey bee nest, she is not attacked, partly due to her resemblance to the East African lowland honey bee queen. As she is capable of parthenogenetic reproduction, she may begin laying eggs which hatch as ""clones"" of herself, which will also lay eggs, causing the parasitic A. m. capensis workers to increase in number. The death of the host colony results from the dwindling numbers of A. m. scutellata workers that perform foraging duties (A. m. capensis workers are greatly under-represented in the foraging force), the death of the queen, and, before queen death, competition for egg laying between A. m. capensis workers and the queen. When the colony dies, the capensis females will seek out a new host colony.",Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Hymenoptera,Apidae,Apis,A.¬†mellifera,A.¬†m. scutellata,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_mellifera_scutellata
