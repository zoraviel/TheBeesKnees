<h2>More Information About the Honey Bee (but not its knees)</h2>

<p>The Cape honey bee or Cape bee (Apis mellifera capensis) is a southern South African subspecies of the western honey bee.  They play a major role in South African agriculture and the economy of the Western Cape by pollinating crops and producing honey in the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>

<p>The Cape honey bee is unique among honey bee subspecies because workers can lay diploid, female eggs, by means of thelytoky, while workers of other subspecies (and, in fact, unmated females of virtually all other eusocial insects) can only lay haploid, male eggs. Not all workers are capable of thelytoky â€šÃ„Ã¬ only those expressing the thelytoky phenotype, which is controlled by a recessive allele at a single locus (workers must be homozygous at this locus to be able to reproduce by thelytoky).</p>
