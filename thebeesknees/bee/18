<h2>More Information About the Honey Bee (but not its knees)</h2>

<p>Apis cerana japonica is a subspecies of the eastern honey bee native to Japan. It is commonly known as the Japanese honey bee (Japanese: â€žÃ‰Ã£â€žÃ‰Ãµâ€žÃ‰â‰¥â€žÃ‰Ã¼â€žÃ‰Ã‘â€žÃ‰Ãªâ€žÃ‰Ã…, Hepburn: Nihon mitsubachi). This subspecies was determined, through an analysis of mitochondrial DNA, to have originally come from the Korean peninsula. They have been observed moving into urban areas in the absence of natural predators.</p>

<p>A. c. japonica is very resistant to the mite Varroa jacobsoni, which is commonly found among A. cerana. It is also able to adapt to weather extremes, has a long flight duration and is less likely to sting than the western counterpart.</p>
