<h2>More Information About the Honey Bee (but not its knees)</h2>

<p>Apis mellifera ligustica is the Italian bee which is a subspecies of the western honey bee (Apis mellifera).</p>

<p>The Italian honey bee is thought to originate from the continental part of Italy, south of the Alps, and north of Sicily. The subspecies may have survived the last Ice Age in Italy. It is genetically a different subspecies than that from the Iberian peninsula and from Sicily. It is the most widely distributed of all honey bees, and has proven adaptable to most climates from subtropical to cool temperate, but it is less successful in humid tropical regions. Italian bees that originate from the Ligurian alps in northern Italy are often referred to as the Ligurian bee.</p>
